        Established in 1956 with 38 charter members, the organization began as
        the National Association of Store Fixture Manufacturers. Membership grew
        slowly in the early years, but exploded in the 1990s following the
        implementation of the associationâ€™s first strategic plan. Originally
        restricted to manufacturers of wood store fixtures, the association
        gradually came to encompass industry suppliers, other types of fixture
        providers, and retail designers. This evolution prompted a name change
        in 2007 to the Association for Retail Environments. The association has
        moved its headquarters to various locations throughout its history,
        including Hollywood, FL, where its office was largely furnished and
        installed by members. During this time, its reach extended
        internationally, with members in more than 30 countries all over the
        world. Run by members for members, the association has seen 31
        presidents, as the volunteer leadership is designed to rotate. Staffing
        has been headed by a succession of four executive directors over the
        years. The association merged with the National Association of Display
        Industries (NADI) in 2001 and assumed administration of the Planning and
        Visual Education Partnership (PAVE) in 2006. In October 2015, the
        Association for Retail Environments (A.R.E.) merged with Point of
        Purchase Advertising International (POPAI) to become Shop Environments
        Association. Established in 1936, POPAI was a not-for-profit association
        for the in-store marketing industry. International in scope, its
        membership was made up of leading retailers, CPGs, brand agencies,
        producers and educators committed to relevant shopper marketing research
        and education. A.R.E. was established in 1956 as the National
        Association of Store Fixture Manufacturers. The association merged with
        the National Association of Display Industries (NADI) in 2001 and
        assumed administration of the Planning and Visual Education Partnership
        (PAVE) in 2006.
